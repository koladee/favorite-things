`QUESTION 2`

*How long did you spend on the coding test below? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.*

`ANSWER 2`

**The total accumulated time spent was  approximately 13 hours in the span of 2 working days.**

**If I had more time, I would have authenticated the API endpoints with Auth0. Considering the time frame, I had to neglect the Auth0 authentication, as I don't know exactly when the application for this job will close.**

`QUESTION 3`

*What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.*

`ANSWER 3`

**I would like to say, I only research on any feature of a programming language that is able to solve the present problem before me, in a nutshell, I am more of a problem solving or algorithm driven developer than a syntax driven developer.**

`QUESTION 4`

*How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?*

`ANSWER 4`

**With the little experience that I have with working in the production environment, performance issues begin to surface when the traffic is becoming very high and at this point in time it is important to take note of the memory consumption of the software and also to take note of how much time it take database queries to execute.**

**Yes, I have been in situations that I have to carry this out. What I did was to carry out code a review to optimise functions, classes and queryset and most importantly implement load balancing to help manage traffic efficiently.**
